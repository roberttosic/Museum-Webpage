His work gets catagorized in different periods, which happen to be the Blue Period (1901-1904), the Rose Period (1904-1906), the African-influenced Period (1907,1909), and the Cubism Period (1909-1919). Guernica is one of his most famous paintings, which is considered the most famous post-war painting of all time.
