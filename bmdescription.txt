The British Museum has one of the largest collections in a museum in the world. It has around 8 million pieces of work, and has work that spans from the beginning of human culture, all the way to the present era.

When the Museum was made in 1753, it was the first of a new type of museum. It did not belong to the kingdom, and it also did not belong to the church. It was open to everyone in the public, in its pursuit to collect as much artwork as humanly possible.
