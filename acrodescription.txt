The Acropolis Museum was created to have every single artifact from the Acropolis of Athens. There are around 4000 objects that are exhibited over a large area of 14,000 square meters. A big motivate for making the museum was to have a place to store any artwork or artifacts in general because the Parthenon Marbles were in the United Kingdom due to Greece not having a suitable place to hold it.

The museum is the largest modern building made close to the ancient site Acropolis Hill. Its location sparked a giant controversy, because it was built over an archaelogical site in the Markrygianni neighbourhood. Not only did they build on the land, but old buildings that were in front of the museum were taken down. Many had concerns over if the museum belonged in that area.
